In this study we implement a general artificial neural network framework.
Our framework allows us to construct neural networks with arbitrary input, hidden, and output units as well as an arbitrary number of hidden layers.
The user is also able to specify the learn rate, number of epochs to train the neural network, and whether to do cross validated training with n folds.
This framework allows us to explore the performance and accuracy trade offs of varying the neural network parameters.
For this study, we utilize the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set~\cite{wolberg1990multisurface} to motivate the necessity of parameter space exploration.
We also compare the performance and accuracy of training a single neural network to that of training an ensemble of neural networks.
We show <list some results/generalizations>.
