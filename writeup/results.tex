Plots we have data for:\\
1. average accuracy for 1 hidden layer hidden units vary from 1-10 using 10 fold cross validation, epoch = 10\\
2. average accuracy for 2 hidden layer hidden units vary from 1-10 using 10 fold cross validation, epoch = 100\\
(1 and 2 will be combined into a single table, wbcd data)\\
3. average accuracy for 1 hidden layer hidden units vary from 1-120, epoch = 1000\\
4. average accraucy for 2 hidden layer hidden units vary from 1-120, epoch = 1000\\
(3 and 4 will combine into a single table, face data)\\

TODO: Add the results\\
5. Ensemble of neural networks using the best combination of parameters from 1 and 2 (plot varying the number of neural nets)\\
6. Ensemble of neural networks using the best combination of parameters from 3 and 4 (plot varying the number of neural nets)\\
